# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
## Required Homework/Tasks

### Installing AWS CLI
I successfully installed the AWS CLI and made edits to the YAML file. However, I encountered some issues during the commit process. When opening the new workspace in Gitpod, I can verify my AWS credentials, but the AWS CLI commands are not auto-completing as expected. Additionally, the YAML file in Gitpod still displays an exclamation mark, indicating that there may be unresolved issues.
